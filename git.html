        <h1>Git</h1>
        <p>
Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers<br>
Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:<br>
git init creates a new Git repository<br>
git status inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area<br>
git add adds files from the working directory to the staging area<br>
git diff shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area<br>
git commit permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository<br>
git log shows a list of all previous commits<br>
git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory. SHORTCUT  (git checkout -- filename)<br>
git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.<br>
git reset commit_SHA: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.<br>
To add every file in the working directory to the staging area, instead of adding each file individually, you can use a shortcut - git add .<br>

        <h2>Conventions of a Good README File</h2>
        <p>
Your README file should be as good as your project itself.<br>
Make your project stand out look professional by at least including the following elements in your README:<br>
Project Title: the name of your project<br>
Description: This is an extremely important component of the README. You should describe the main purpose of your project. Answer questions like “why did you build this project?” and “what problem(s) does it solve?”. It also helps to include your motivations for the project and what you learned from it.<br>
Features: If your project has multiple features, list them here. Don’t be afraid to brag if your project has unique features that make it stand out. You can even add screenshots and gifs to show off the features.<br>
How to use: Here, you should write step-by-step instructions on how to install and use your project. Any software or package requirements should also be listed here.<br>
Technologies: List all the technologies and/or frameworks you used and what purpose they serve in your project.<br>
Collaborators: If others have contributed to your project in any way, it is important to give them credit for their work. Write your team members’ or collaborators’ names here along with a link to their GitHub profile.<br>
License: It’s also important to list a license on your README so other developers can understand what they can and cannot do with your project. You can use this guide to help you choose a license.<br>
